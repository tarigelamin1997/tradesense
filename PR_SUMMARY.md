# Pull Request: Add API Health Check Tests

## Summary
- Created comprehensive API health check script that tests all critical endpoints
- Added integration tests for complete user workflows (authentication, trading, analytics, AI)
- Documented all failing production endpoints in detailed report

## Test Coverage
The new tests cover:
- Health check endpoints
- API documentation endpoints
- Authentication flow (register, login, refresh)
- Trading workflow (create, list, analytics)
- AI insights generation
- Portfolio management
- Error handling and CORS configuration
- Rate limiting functionality
- Performance benchmarks

## Key Findings
- All production endpoints returning 404 errors
- Application appears to not be deployed at the Railway URL
- Tests are ready to validate endpoints once deployment is fixed

## Files Added
- `tests/api_health_check.py` - Standalone health check script
- `tests/test_api_integration.py` - Pytest integration test suite
- `tests/requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies

## How to Run
```bash
# Run health check
python3 tests/api_health_check.py
