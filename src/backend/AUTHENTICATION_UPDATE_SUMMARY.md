# Authentication Update Summary

## ✅ httpOnly Cookie Authentication - COMPLETED

### What Was Done
The critical authentication blocker has been resolved. The backend now fully supports httpOnly cookie authentication as required by the frontend.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `/api/v1/auth/router.py`**:
   - Login endpoint now sets httpOnly cookies with proper security settings
   - Cookie configuration includes:
     - `httponly=True` - Prevents JavaScript access
     - `secure=True` in production - HTTPS only
     - `samesite="lax"` - CSRF protection
     - Proper expiration time matching JWT token
   - Logout endpoint clears the cookie
   - Response still includes JWT token for backward compatibility

2. **Updated `/api/deps.py`**:
   - `get_current_user` now accepts both cookie and header authentication
   - Prefers cookies (more secure) but falls back to headers for API clients
   - Seamless support for both frontend (cookies) and mobile/API (headers)

3. **CORS Configuration in `main.py`**:
   - Already had `allow_credentials=True` which is required for cookies
   - Properly configured origins for development and production

### Testing Results
- ✅ Login sets httpOnly cookie "auth-token"
- ✅ Protected endpoints accept cookie authentication
- ✅ Logout clears the cookie
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for JWT in headers
- ✅ CORS properly configured for credentials

### Frontend Impact
The frontend engineer can now continue their work without any authentication issues:
- Login will automatically set secure httpOnly cookies
- All API requests with `credentials: 'include'` will work
- No need to manage tokens in JavaScript
- Enhanced security with httpOnly cookies

### Next Steps
Moving on to Week 1 security implementations:
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
2. OAuth2 integrations  
3. Enhanced secrets management
4. Database connection pooling

## Technical Details

### Cookie Settings
```python
response.set_cookie(
    key="auth-token",
    value=access_token,
    httponly=True,
    secure=os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development") == "production",
    samesite="lax",
    max_age=ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES * 60,
    path="/",
    domain=None
)
```

### Dual Authentication Support
```python
# Try cookie first (frontend uses this)
token = token_from_cookie

# Fallback to Authorization header (mobile/API clients)
if not token and token_from_header:
    token = token_from_header
```

This implementation provides the best of both worlds - secure cookie-based auth for web frontends and traditional bearer token auth for API clients.
