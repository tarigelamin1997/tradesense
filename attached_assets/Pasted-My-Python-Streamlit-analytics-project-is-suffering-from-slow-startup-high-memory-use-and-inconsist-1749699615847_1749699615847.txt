My Python/Streamlit analytics project is suffering from slow startup, high memory use, and inconsistent dependency handling. Please implement the following configuration and code-level optimizations to achieve reliable, fast, and reproducible performance.

1. Slim and Pin Dependencies
Create a core-requirements.txt file with ONLY essential packages (edit this list if more are absolutely required):

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
streamlit==1.31.1" > core-requirements.txt
Remove any unneeded packages from requirements, including legacy or unused dependencies.

2. Pip and Build Caching
Create a persistent pip cache directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p ~/.cache/pip
export PIP_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/pip"
3. .replit Configuration
Create or update .replit to:

ini
Copy
Edit
[run]
command = "pip install -r core-requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py"

[packager]
afterInstall = "python -c 'print(\"Dependencies cached\")'"

[interpreter]
timeout = 60
4. Nix Environment Setup
Create or update replit.nix to use Python 3.10 or 3.11 (not 3.13):

nix
Copy
Edit
{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.python310
    pkgs.python310Packages.pip
    pkgs.python310Packages.virtualenv
  ];
  env = {
    PIP_CACHE_DIR = "/home/runner/.cache/pip";
  };
}
5. App Code Optimizations
In app.py (and any large data loads):

Use Streamlit’s caching on data-loaders:

python
Copy
Edit
@st.cache_data
def load_data(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)
Import and display memory stats:

python
Copy
Edit
import psutil
st.sidebar.write(f"Memory: {psutil.virtual_memory().percent}% used")
6. Virtual Environment and Cleanup
Clean and recreate venv as needed to clear package bloat:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf venv/ && python -m venv venv
7. Verification & Monitoring
Time the dependency install step:

bash
Copy
Edit
time pip install -r core-requirements.txt
Monitor live memory with:

bash
Copy
Edit
htop
Confirm the following on completion:

App starts in <60 seconds from “Run”

RAM usage remains under 1GB for core workflows

No slow “import”/“pip install” phases after first run

Expected Outcome
70%+ reduction in cold-start time

Stable Streamlit sessions

Minimal RAM usage

No repeated package install delays

Environment persists between sessions

If any part of this fails or is blocked by the Replit platform, please document what step was unsuccessful and recommend the closest alternative.
