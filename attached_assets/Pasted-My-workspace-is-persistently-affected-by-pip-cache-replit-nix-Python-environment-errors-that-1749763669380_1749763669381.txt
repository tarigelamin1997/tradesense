My workspace is persistently affected by “pip cache / replit / nix / Python environment” errors that disrupt package installation, slow down builds, and randomly break dependencies.
No amount of manual cleanup, venv deletion, .cache purge, or config resets has fixed it.
I am on the Core plan, so resources should not be an issue.
This issue has already wasted significant development time and blocks business progress.

Here’s what I need from you, Replit AI/support:

Full Environment Diagnosis:

Identify any and all sources of conflict, corruption, or “stickiness” in my pip cache, Python environment, package manager configs, and Nix setup.

Check for:

Orphaned or hidden venvs, .venv, pycache, .cache, and .config folders anywhere in the project tree (not just root)

Zombie processes or stale pip/nix/virtualenv locks

Broken symlinks or workspace-level pip cache/config artifacts

Multiple, mismatched, or legacy requirements files

Any .python-version, pyenv, or interpreter overrides present

Automated and Manual Deep Clean:

Run all necessary cleanup commands recursively:

rm -rf venv/ .venv/ .cache/ __pycache__/ .config/

find . -name "*.pyc" -delete

find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +

Remove any .python-version, .env, or other stray config files

Ensure Replit’s workspace environment is “factory reset” for Python, with no legacy state.

Standardize Config Files:

Only one requirements file (core-requirements.txt or requirements.txt), minimal and accurate.

.replit should have only ONE [run] block, with the correct Streamlit or app entry command.

replit.nix should be EMPTY except for { pkgs }: { deps = []; }

No workflow or module soup, no virtualenv blocks, no redundant config sections.

Package Manager Sanity Check:

Ensure pip is the ONLY active package manager (not pipenv, poetry, conda, etc.)

Nix should not install or override Python packages (deps list empty).

Confirm that “pip install” uses the correct Python and the workspace-level cache.

Validate Environment with End-to-End Test:

After cleaning, run:

scss
Copy
Edit
pip install --no-cache-dir -r core-requirements.txt
python -c "import streamlit, pandas, numpy, plotly, openpyxl, fpdf2; print('All imports successful')"
If there are errors, diagnose the exact cause (not just “pip failed”) and FIX IT.

Persistent Solution:

If this workspace is irreparably corrupted, recommend and assist in:

Migrating all code/assets to a brand new workspace

Restoring only clean code/config files, NOT old venv/cache folders

If this is a platform-level or CDN-side bug, escalate internally and provide me a realistic ETA or workaround.

Final Report:

Summarize EXACTLY what was wrong, what was fixed, and why this solution is robust.

Advise how to avoid this in the future, including any workspace hygiene, limits, or feature flag advice specific to Core plan users.

This is business critical—do not just give me generic “try cleaning cache” tips.
I want a full, “one and done” solution—fix whatever you find, or migrate my code to a pristine environment and guarantee future reliability.
If any step fails, paste the full shell output and your diagnosis.
