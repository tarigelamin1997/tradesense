# Files to Delete

This directory contains files that are candidates for deletion during the project restructuring.
All files here have been backed up and committed to version control.

## Directory Structure

- **streamlit-legacy/**: Original Streamlit application files
- **old-scripts/**: Deprecated scripts and utilities
- **deprecated-assets/**: Old assets no longer needed
- **old-configs/**: Configuration files from previous versions

## Important Notes

1. All files in this directory have been backed up in:
   - `/backups/` directory with timestamped archives
   - Git history (commit: pre-restructure-backup tag)

2. Review each file before final deletion
3. Consider if any code patterns or logic should be preserved
4. Check for any dependencies before removing

## Migration Status

Files will be moved here during the restructuring process.
Once confirmed they are no longer needed, they can be safely deleted.
