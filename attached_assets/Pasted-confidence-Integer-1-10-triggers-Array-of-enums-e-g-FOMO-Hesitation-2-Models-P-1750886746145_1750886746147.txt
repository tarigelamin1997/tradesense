Implement a Psychology & Emotion Tracker system in TradeSense.

🧨 Problem:
Right now, we capture notes but not **psychological states** like emotion, confidence, or mental triggers. This leaves blind spots in user performance evaluation.

✅ Solution:
Allow users to tag each journal entry with emotion data: emotional state, confidence score (1–10), and mental triggers (e.g., FOMO, hesitation).

🛠️ Implementation Steps:
1. DB:
   - Extend journal_entries OR create separate emotions table
   - Fields: emotion (enum), confidence (int), triggers (list), timestamps
2. Backend:
   - Pydantic model `EmotionData`
   - Accept optional `emotion_data` in journal create/update endpoints
3. Frontend:
   - In journal entry UI: add emotion selector, confidence slider, and trigger checklist
   - Display this metadata with entries
4. Optional later:
   - Generate analytics from emotion patterns
   - Add AI-powered warnings or reflections

🎯 Outcome:
TradeSense now becomes an **emotional intelligence platform** as well — helping users catch self-sabotage before it happens, track psychological trends, and improve discipline by becoming self-aware.
