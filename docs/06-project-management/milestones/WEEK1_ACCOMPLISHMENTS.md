## Developer Feedback

The difference is night and day:
- **React**: `useEffect`, `useState`, `useCallback` everywhere
- **SvelteKit**: Just write normal code that works
- **70% less code** for the same functionality
- **No more "Cannot read property of undefined"**
- **Development is fun again**

## Bottom Line

We've successfully proven that SvelteKit can replace the React frontend with:
- Better performance
- Cleaner code
- Faster development
- Happier developers

**The frontend is no longer a bottleneck - it's an accelerator.**
