Drop everything and focus.

You're not just my code assistant right now â€” you're my lead full-stack engineer, product-focused architect, and execution machine. We are restructuring this **entire TradeSense project** â€” end to end â€” in under 2 hours.

This is a professional, production-grade cloud trading platform. The backend is FastAPI. The frontend is React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Zustand + Recharts. Weâ€™re aiming for **modular, scalable, team-ready structure** that will also support a future React Native mobile build.

Hereâ€™s what I want from you immediately:

ðŸš€ GOAL: Fully restructure the frontend codebase. Clean, modular, production-grade.  
You have full permission to create, delete, refactor, rename, and restructure files and folders as needed. Think like a software architect â€” not a junior dev.

You MUST:
1. Audit the current structure and immediately rework everything into a clean, domain-driven layout
2. Ensure these folders exist and are properly populated:
   - `features/` (domain logic, pages, layouts)
   - `components/` (reusable UI elements)
   - `services/` (API integration, split per domain)
   - `hooks/` (custom hooks)
   - `store/` (Zustand slices, modular)
   - `utils/` (pure functions, formatters)
   - `lib/` (shared logic, if needed)
   - `routes/` (optional, if you want to abstract routes separately)
3. Verify Tailwind setup and ShadCN integration
4. Check Zustand: modular slices? clean separation? scalability?
5. Split and optimize API logic. Separate auth, trades, reports, etc.
6. Clean up all test files, boilerplate junk, or unnecessary cruft
7. Remove all hardcoded junk and migrate to constants/configs if needed
8. Check for any global UI state that should be centralized (e.g., modals, notifications, theme)
9. Make sure everything compiles and runs cleanly during the transition â€” don't break anything
10. Donâ€™t explain what youâ€™re doing unless you need to ask. Just **do it**. Show me final structure and key logic changes once done.

Act like youâ€™re getting paid $5,000 an hour and youâ€™re 20 minutes in.

If anything is unclear â€” make a smart decision and move on. Iâ€™m not here to guide you line-by-line. This project needs to be elite. Handle it.
