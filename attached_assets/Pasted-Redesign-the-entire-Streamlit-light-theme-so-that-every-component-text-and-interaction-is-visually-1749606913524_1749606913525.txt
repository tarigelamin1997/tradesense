Redesign the entire Streamlit light theme so that every component, text, and interaction is visually clear, professional, and adheres to top-tier UI/UX and accessibility standards. Fix these issues specifically:

1. Background:

Main app background must be pure white (#FFFFFF) or very light gray (#F7F7F7), never yellow, beige, or blue-tinted.



2. Text:

All text (headers, subheaders, labels, table content, button text, KPIs, tooltips) must be dark gray or black (#1A1A1A to #222222 or pure #000000). No faded gray or pastel.

Avoid gray-on-gray. Use at least 7:1 contrast ratio for ALL text (check with a WCAG contrast checker).

Table cell text must never be lighter than #222222.



3. Charts:

Axes, labels, tick marks: black or dark gray on white, at full opacity.

Bars/lines: use bold, classic palette (blue, green, red, orange, purple), but always dark enough to stand out against white.

Highlight lines, fills, and tooltips so nothing fades into the background.



4. Tables:

Alternate row backgrounds using very light gray (#F2F2F2) and white.

Table borders: thin, light gray (#E0E0E0).

Selected or hovered rows: slightly bolder border or subtle blue background (#E3F0FF).



5. Buttons & Interactive Elements:

Button backgrounds: medium/dark blue (#2563EB or similar), text pure white.

Disabled buttons: light gray background, clear border, gray text.

Focus/hover states: slightly darker/lighter background, clear outline (not just a color shift).



6. Inputs:

Borders: clear, solid gray (#C1C1C1).

Text inside: dark, high-contrast.

Focus: blue outline (#2563EB or similar), not faint shadow.



7. KPIs, Cards, Metrics:

Card backgrounds: white with subtle shadow, text dark and bold.

Red for negative (use #D32F2F), green for positive (#388E3C), blue for neutral.

Never use pastel, washed-out colors for numbers or deltas.



8. Error/Success/Warning Messages:

Error: red background (#FFECEC), red text (#D32F2F), bold icon.

Success: green background (#E6FFED), green text (#388E3C).

Warning: orange/yellow background (#FFF8E1), dark amber text.

Never put colored text on a color background with low contrast.



9. Sidebar/Menu:

Sidebar background: white or very light gray.

Sidebar text: black or dark gray, bold for active item.

Menu/links: clear hover/focus states, never blue-on-blue.



10. Mobile Responsiveness:

All buttons, inputs, charts, tables, and cards should stack cleanly.

No text or controls should shrink below 14px or run off screen.



11. General Principles:

No element should ever be hard to read, faded, or low-contrast.

Use bold color for call-to-action; never rely on subtlety in light theme.

Test all main pages, dashboard, forms, charts, and errors.

Show me a screenshot or list of all color hex codes and font weights used.




Your result must look like a modern SaaS dashboard—clear, punchy, and ultra-readable, not like a generic Streamlit app. Reference Stripe Dashboard, Linear, or Notion as examples.

Do not just “tweak”—systematically upgrade every component’s clarity and color to these standards. If you use any custom CSS or update theme settings, list exactly what you changed. I will only accept a solution that looks as clean and pro as the best fintech UIs.
