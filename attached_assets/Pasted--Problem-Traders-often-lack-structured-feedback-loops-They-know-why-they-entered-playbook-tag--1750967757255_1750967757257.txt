☢️ Problem
Traders often lack structured feedback loops.
They know why they entered (playbook/tag), but they have no clear feedback on how well they executed.
This leads to:

Repeated errors without awareness

Poor tracking of which strategies truly work

Emotional overreactions (e.g. abandoning a good strategy due to bad execution)

🧬 Proposed Solution
Implement a hybrid feature set inside the TradeSense platform that:

Allows tagging trades with Playbooks / Criteria

Scores execution quality based on objective price data

Generates analytics from both dimensions:

"Playbook A has great win rate when executed well"

"Playbook B underperforms even with perfect execution"

"You perform best when sticking to breakout setups with tight exits"

🔨 Implementation Plan
Break it down into three layers:

✅ 1. Trade Playbook Tagging System
Each trader can define multiple playbooks:

Example: “EMA Breakout”, “Reversal Zone”, “VWAP Bounce”

Playbook includes:

Entry criteria (text)

Exit criteria (text)

Optional risk profile tags (e.g. “High R/R”, “Scalp”)

When entering a trade, they select a playbook

Stored in DB under the trade

✅ 2. Execution Analytics Engine
Automatically scores:

🎯 Entry timing (Did you chase? Enter early? Near pivot?)

💸 Exit timing (Left money? Caught the move?)

⏳ Holding period (too long? too short?)

🧠 R/R behavior (Did the trade fulfill the playbook’s R/R?)

Scores each dimension (0–100) per trade

Save these metrics in the DB

✅ 3. Analytics Dashboard Enhancements
Add filters:

Show performance by playbook

Show average execution score per playbook

Find patterns:

“Trades using Playbook X with entry score >70 have 65% win rate”

“FOMO tags = 22 trades, 9% win rate, -1.4R avg”

Visuals:

Heatmaps of playbook performance

Timeline of execution score improvement

🧠 Why This Helps
Gives traders an honest mirror:

"The problem isn’t the strategy, it’s your execution"

Creates a feedback loop:

Iterate on either playbook rules or trade behavior

Reduces emotional bias and hindsight blindness

Builds data-driven self-awareness
