üö® PHASE: PRODUCTION TRANSITION ‚Äî FULL SYSTEM BUILD REQUIRED

We have now completed the backend refactor of TradeSense using FastAPI.

‚úÖ The backend appears mostly complete with working routes and modular services.
‚ùå However, the system is not usable yet. There's only a white screen, and the app is not running end-to-end.

Your mission is to now **move this project into a fully functioning, production-ready full-stack application** with the following required tasks:

---

### üîß FRONTEND CONNECTION

1. Create a minimal frontend using **React** inside a `/frontend` folder
2. Connect the following backend APIs using `fetch` or Axios:
   - `POST /api/auth/login`
   - `POST /api/auth/register`
   - `GET /api/analytics/dashboard`
   - `POST /api/journal/entries`
   - `GET /api/journal/entries`
3. Display the analytics output as charts (use any charting lib like Recharts or Chart.js)
4. Show login form, registration form, and journal submission in a simple but clean UI
5. Auto-handle JWT token in localStorage and Authorization header

---

### üß™ CI / TEST SETUP

1. Create a `tests/` folder with Pytest-based tests for:
   - User auth flow
   - Token-based access
   - Journaling logic
   - Analytics endpoint response
2. Add a GitHub Actions workflow:
   - On every push to `main`, run tests using `pytest`
   - Output results in terminal log

---

### üê≥ DOCKER & DEPLOYMENT

1. Refactor the `Dockerfile` if needed to:
   - Run Uvicorn properly
   - Serve frontend with production build
   - Use `.env` safely
2. Add a `docker-compose.yml` that runs:
   - Backend (FastAPI)
   - Frontend (React)
   - SQLite DB or service (volume-persistent)
3. Configure for deployment on **Render**, **Railway**, or **DockerHub + VPS**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è FINAL SYSTEM READINESS CHECKLIST

- ‚úÖ Ensure `.env` is used properly for:
  - SECRET_KEY
  - SMTP credentials
  - DB config
- ‚úÖ Replace white screen with real frontend
- ‚úÖ Add error boundaries and toast feedback
- ‚úÖ Add CORS support for frontend API calls
- ‚úÖ Provide final `README.md` with install + run instructions

---

‚è≥ You are in the final stretch. Build this as if you‚Äôre shipping the real version to real users who will judge it. No shortcuts. No placeholders. Give it a heartbeat.
