Despite saying it was fixed, Replit didn’t actually move the alias MentalMap = MentalMapEntry below the class. The error log still shows the alias on line 16, which is before the class definition.

🔍 Confirming from the logs:
python
Copy
Edit
File "/home/runner/workspace/backend/models/mental_map.py", line 16, in <module>
    MentalMap = MentalMapEntry
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'MentalMapEntry' is not defined
That proves beyond a doubt: MentalMapEntry was never defined before this alias line.

✅ The One-Line Fix (Mandatory Manual Intervention)
You need to go to:

bash
Copy
Edit
backend/models/mental_map.py
And cut this line:

python
Copy
Edit
MentalMap = MentalMapEntry
Then paste it at the end of the file, like this:

python
Copy
Edit
class MentalMapEntry(Base):
    __tablename__ = "mental_map"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    concept = Column(String)
    value = Column(String)

    user = relationship("User", back_populates="mental_maps")

# ✅ Add this line at the very end
MentalMap = MentalMapEntry
Save the file. Don’t trust Replit's hallucination. This has to be manually done now.

🔁 After Manual Fix, Run Again:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
cd backend && timeout 10s python main.py || echo "✅ Backend startup verified"
If everything goes well, you’ll see:

✅ All tests collected and executed

✅ No NameError

✅ Proper backend startup

🧠 Optional Safety Net: Auto-Verify Fix
If you want a one-liner to verify the fix, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
grep -n "MentalMap = MentalMapEntry" backend/models/mental_map.py
You should see a line number greater than the line where the class MentalMapEntry is defined (let’s say line 10). If it shows line 16 again, you’ve got the alias in the wrong place again.

🧱 Bottom Line
This error is not theoretical anymore—it’s hard evidence Replit didn’t apply the fix. Once you move that alias manually, the tests and backend will finally be unblocked.
