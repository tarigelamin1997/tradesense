Great. Now we're moving into Phase 2.

Youâ€™ve laid a solid foundation â€” now I want you to deepen the engineering work and harden this codebase for production and expansion.

Hereâ€™s what I want you to do next:

ðŸ”¸ 1. **Testing Setup**
- Configure Jest + React Testing Library
- Set up one test file per major component and feature module
- Include sample tests for auth slice, trade slice, and at least one API module

ðŸ”¸ 2. **Global Error Boundary**
- Implement a robust global error boundary with fallback UI
- Catch frontend runtime errors cleanly and report them to the console

ðŸ”¸ 3. **React DevTools / Performance Optimizations**
- Add React DevTools setup instructions
- Enable React StrictMode if not already
- Confirm lazy-loading of all feature pages is working with suspense fallback

ðŸ”¸ 4. **API Documentation**
- Create a markdown file that documents each service module (`auth`, `trades`, etc.)
- Show available methods, their inputs/outputs, and usage examples

ðŸ”¸ 5. **Storybook Integration**
- Set up Storybook and configure at least 3 core UI components inside it
- Document props and variants (e.g., Button, Card, Input)

ðŸ”¸ 6. **Authentication Flow Testing**
- Test login, logout, and token refresh logic manually
- Ensure all edge cases are handled: expired token, invalid login, missing headers

ðŸ”¸ 7. **Mobile Optimization Pass**
- Run a responsive audit for screens <768px
- Refactor any layouts or spacing issues
- Ensure usability on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (touch targets, fonts, etc.)

ðŸ”¸ 8. **Accessibility Audit**
- Run a quick accessibility pass using `axe-core` or similar
- Add ARIA labels to all key components: buttons, forms, modals
- Make sure keyboard navigation works across pages

ðŸ§  You are authorized to use your own reasoning to solve gaps, handle unexpected patterns, or propose stronger alternatives if anything in the current structure falls short during this phase.

Once all steps are completed, provide:
- A brief implementation summary
- A commit log or changelog by area (test, UI, infra, docs)
- Any TODOs or tradeoffs made

Letâ€™s harden this codebase like itâ€™s going into production tomorrow. Go.
