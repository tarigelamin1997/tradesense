# CORS Configuration Workaround

## Issue
The frontend deployed at `https://frontend-jj8nosjl0-tarig-ahmeds-projects.vercel.app` is being blocked by CORS because the backend services don't include this specific URL in their allowed origins.

## Temporary Solution
While waiting for the backend services to redeploy with the updated CORS configuration, you can use one of these workarounds:

### Option 1: Use a Browser Extension (Quickest)
1. Install a CORS browser extension like "CORS Unblock" or "Allow CORS"
2. Enable it only for your Vercel domain
3. This will bypass CORS checks in your browser

### Option 2: Deploy Frontend to a Known URL
Deploy the frontend to one of the already allowed URLs:
- `https://tradesense.vercel.app`
- `https://frontend-og3gd5s4j-tarig-ahmeds-projects.vercel.app`

### Option 3: Use Local Development
Run the frontend locally where CORS is already configured:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Permanent Solution (In Progress)
1. ✅ Updated CORS configuration in all backend services
2. ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub
3. ⏳ Waiting for Railway to redeploy services (usually takes 5-10 minutes)
4. Once deployed, the frontend at the new URL will work without any workarounds

## How to Verify Services are Updated
Run this command to check if the gateway accepts requests from your frontend:
```bash
curl -I https://tradesense-gateway-production.up.railway.app/health \
  -H "Origin: https://frontend-jj8nosjl0-tarig-ahmeds-projects.vercel.app" \
  -X OPTIONS
```

Look for the `access-control-allow-origin` header in the response. If it shows your URL, the update is complete.

## Current Status
- Gateway: ⏳ Deploying
- Auth Service: ⏳ Deploying
- Other Services: ⏳ Will be updated in next deployment

The authentication system should start working as soon as the gateway and auth service are redeployed with the new CORS configuration.
