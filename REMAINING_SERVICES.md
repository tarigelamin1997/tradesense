## Temporary Solution

While waiting for Railway upgrade, you can:

1. **Run these services locally**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Market Data
   cd services/market-data
   python src/main.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - Billing
   cd services/billing
   python src/main.py
   
   # Terminal 3 - AI
   cd services/ai
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Use ngrok for temporary public URLs**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8001  # For Market Data
   ngrok http 8002  # For Billing
   ngrok http 8003  # For AI
   ```

3. **Update Gateway environment variables** with ngrok URLs

## Priority Order

When you upgrade Railway:

1. **Deploy Market Data first** (needed for real-time quotes)
2. **Deploy AI Service** (adds significant value)
3. **Deploy Billing last** (can be added when monetizing)

## Current Working Architecture

Even without these 3 services, you have:
- ✅ User authentication (Auth)
- ✅ Trade management (Trading)
- ✅ Performance analytics (Analytics)
- ✅ API Gateway routing
