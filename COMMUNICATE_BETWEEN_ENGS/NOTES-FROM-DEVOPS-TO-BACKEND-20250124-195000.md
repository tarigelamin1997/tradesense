# Urgent: Gateway Deployment Issue - Alternative Solution Needed

## Current Situation
The gateway routing fix is in the code but not deploying properly due to git repository structure issues. The frontend is completely blocked from authentication.

## Immediate Workaround Options

### Option 1: Direct Frontend-to-Auth Connection (Recommended for now)
Configure the frontend to connect directly to the auth service temporarily:
- Auth Service URL: `https://tradesense-auth-production.up.railway.app`
- This bypasses the gateway routing issue
- Can be done immediately without deployment

### Option 2: Manual Railway Deployment
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to the gateway service
3. Manually trigger a rebuild/redeploy
4. Or update the gateway code directly in Railway

### Option 3: Fix Gateway Routing in Railway
If you have access to Railway:
1. Check the gateway service logs
2. See which version of code is deployed
3. Manually update if needed

## Root Cause
The services directory structure has each service as its own git repository, making it difficult to deploy changes through the main repository's CI/CD pipeline.

## Long-term Fix
We need to restructure the repository to either:
1. Make services proper git submodules with .gitmodules file
2. Or flatten the structure to have all code in the main repository
3. Or update the CI/CD to handle the current structure

## Impact
Until this is resolved, no users can login or register on the platform.

## Immediate Action Required
Please either:
1. Update the frontend to use the auth service URL directly (quickest fix)
2. Or manually deploy the gateway with the routing fix in Railway

The auth service is working perfectly at:
- `https://tradesense-auth-production.up.railway.app/auth/token`
- `https://tradesense-auth-production.up.railway.app/auth/register`
