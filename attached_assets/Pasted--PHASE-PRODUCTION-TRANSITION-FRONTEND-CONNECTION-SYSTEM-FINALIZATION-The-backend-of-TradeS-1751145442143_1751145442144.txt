üö® PHASE: PRODUCTION TRANSITION ‚Äî FRONTEND CONNECTION & SYSTEM FINALIZATION

The backend of TradeSense has now been refactored using FastAPI and is mostly complete.

‚úÖ The project includes a UI that was built during the development process. This UI is already present in the codebase and must be retained ‚Äî do not replace it or rebuild it from scratch.

‚ùå However, the current app only shows a white screen when run. It‚Äôs non-functional and likely due to broken integration, missing imports, or frontend/backend disconnects.

---

### üîß TASK: FIX AND CONNECT THE EXISTING FRONTEND

1. **Diagnose and fix** why the current UI is not loading (white screen)
   - Likely issues: missing entry point, JS errors, unmounted components, broken `index.html`, or missing imports
2. Connect the existing UI to the backend:
   - `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Üí login form
   - `POST /api/auth/register` ‚Üí registration form
   - `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` ‚Üí show KPIs/metrics
   - `POST /api/journal/entries` ‚Üí trade entry form
   - `GET /api/journal/entries` ‚Üí display trade logs
3. Ensure **token-based authentication** is supported (JWT stored in localStorage or sessionStorage)
4. Fix all forms, buttons, charts, and pages that were already created ‚Äî make them functional with API calls
5. Display backend feedback (success/failures) via visible alerts or UI notifications

---

### üß™ ADD BASIC TESTS & CI

1. Add Pytest-based tests in `/tests/` folder:
   - Auth flow
   - Journaling
   - Analytics
2. Add a simple **GitHub Actions workflow**:
   - Trigger on `main` branch push
   - Run `pytest`
   - Report output in CI logs

---

### üê≥ DOCKER & DEPLOYMENT

1. Use the existing `Dockerfile`, or improve it:
   - Make sure Uvicorn starts the app
   - Serve the UI correctly (e.g. from `static/` or `templates/` if using a templated system)
2. Add a `docker-compose.yml` for:
   - FastAPI backend
   - SQLite (optional volume)
3. Add `.env` support for sensitive configs

---

### ‚úÖ FINAL READINESS CHECKLIST

- Fix the white screen
- Connect existing UI to backend
- Ensure all forms, charts, and views are functional
- Support JWT-based login and token handling
- Test API functionality manually or via `/docs`
- Add feedback handling (alerts/toasts)
- Ready the app for user testing and public deployment

This is a full system delivery task. Do not build a new UI ‚Äî make the existing one work.
