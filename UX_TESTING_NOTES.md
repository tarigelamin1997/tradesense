## Testing from a Demanding User's Perspective ($99/month expectations)

---

## üéØ FIRST-TIME USER EXPERIENCE (5 Second Test)

### ‚ùå Landing Page Issues
1. **NO LANDING PAGE EXISTS** - Users go straight to login
   - Impact: CRITICAL - No value proposition, no features showcase, no pricing
   - User reaction: "What is this? Why should I pay $99/month?"
   - Missing: Hero section, feature list, testimonials, pricing tiers, demo

2. **Zero Brand Identity**
   - No logo visible
   - Generic "TradeSense" text with no visual identity
   - No color scheme that stands out
   - Looks like a student project, not a $99/month product

3. **No Social Proof**
   - No testimonials
   - No user count ("Join 10,000+ traders")
   - No success stories
   - No partner/integration logos

4. **No Clear CTA Strategy**

   - No checkmarks for requirements met
   - No color coding (red/yellow/green)

   - No specific field validation feedback
   - User has to guess what went wrong

8. **No Social Sign-up**
