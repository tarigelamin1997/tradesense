☢️ Problem
Traders often fail not because of bad strategies — but because they don’t understand their emotional triggers, impulses, and psychological tendencies.
Without capturing post-trade emotions and reflections:

There’s no learning from mistakes

Emotional patterns (revenge trades, overtrading, hesitation) repeat endlessly

It becomes impossible to correlate psychological state with performance

🧬 Proposed Solution
Add a Post-Trade Reflection & Emotional Tagging System to the TradeSense platform.

It will allow traders to:

Quickly log emotional states and reasons after each trade

Tag key feelings (e.g. FOMO, confidence, fear, frustration)

Write brief reflections ("I broke my rule here", "I followed the plan")

Later visualize emotional trends and their impact on performance

This turns TradeSense into a mental performance coach, not just a journal.

🔨 Implementation Plan
✅ 1. Backend Schema Update
Extend the trades table:

emotional_tags: List of enums (e.g. ["FOMO", "Fear", "Greed"])

reflection_notes: Text field

emotional_score: Integer (e.g. 1–10 scale of emotional control)

executed_plan: Boolean (true if they followed their plan)

✅ 2. Frontend UI Enhancements
In the trade detail or trade entry form:

Add a “Post-Trade Reflection” section:

Multi-select tag component for emotional states

1–10 slider: “How emotionally controlled were you?”

Yes/No toggle: “Did you follow your plan?”

Textarea: “Write your reflection in 1 sentence”

✅ 3. Analytics Integration
Add these visualizations:

Correlation between emotions and performance

E.g. “Trades with FOMO tag have -0.7R average return”

Breakdown of followed-plan vs broken-plan PnL

Radar chart of emotional control vs. R return

Track improvement in emotional control score over time

🧠 Why This Helps
Creates awareness of mental patterns that sabotage or support profits

Helps eliminate recurring emotional mistakes

Builds emotional intelligence through data

Reinforces discipline by showing that following the plan = better results
