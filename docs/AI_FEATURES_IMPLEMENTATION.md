## üî• Key Features

### Trade Intelligence Score
```typescript
interface TradeScore {
  overall_score: number;     // 0-100 composite score
  execution_score: number;   // Entry/exit quality
  timing_score: number;      // Market timing analysis
  strategy_score: number;    // Strategy effectiveness
  risk_reward_ratio: number; // Risk/reward calculation
  insights: string[];        // AI-generated insights
  recommendations: string[]; // Actionable suggestions
}
```

### Behavioral Analytics

### Pre-Trade Analysis
```typescript
interface PreTradeAnalysis {
  should_take_trade: boolean;
  confidence_score: number;
  risk_score: number;
  pattern_matches: PatternMatch[];
  market_alignment: boolean;
  psychological_readiness: number;
  suggested_position_size: number;
  warnings: string[];
}
```
