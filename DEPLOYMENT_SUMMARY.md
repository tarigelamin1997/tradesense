## ⚠️ Railway Free Plan Limit Reached

You've hit the free plan resource limit. Options:

### Option 1: Upgrade Railway Plan
- Go to Railway dashboard → Settings → Billing
- Upgrade to Hobby plan ($5/month)
- Continue deploying remaining services

### Option 2: Consolidate Services
Since we have a working microservices architecture locally, you can:
1. Deploy only core services to Railway
2. Run other services locally or on other platforms
3. Or combine some services (e.g., AI + Analytics)

### Option 3: Use Alternative Platforms
- Deploy Market Data to Render.com (free tier)
- Deploy AI service to Fly.io (free tier)
- Keep Billing on Railway when you upgrade

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Configure the 4 deployed services** in Railway dashboard
2. **Test the core flow** with `./test-railway-flow.sh`
3. **Decide on deployment strategy** for remaining services

## 💡 Recommendation

Since you have 4 core services deployed:
1. Configure them first
2. Test that Auth → Trading → Analytics flow works
3. Then decide if you need to upgrade Railway or use alternative platforms

The core trading functionality is ready to go!
