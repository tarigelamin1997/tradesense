# üöÄ Railway & Vercel DevOps Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive DevOps strategy specifically designed for TradeSense's Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) infrastructure.

## Current Infrastructure Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Backend**: 7 microservices deployed on Railway
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit app on Vercel (after SSR fixes)
- **Databases**: 5 PostgreSQL + 1 Redis on Railway
- **HTTPS**: Automatic SSL certificates
- **Deployments**: GitHub integration active

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Security scanning and hardening
- Automated testing in CI/CD
- Cost tracking and optimization
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring (APM)

## üî¥ Priority 1: Security Implementation (Next 24 Hours)

### 1.1 GitHub Security Setup
```bash
# Run the security setup script
./scripts/railway-security-setup.sh
```

This will:
- Apply branch protection rules
- Enable security scanning
- Configure CODEOWNERS
- Set up Dependabot

### 1.2 Railway Security Audit
1. **Rotate all secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Generate new JWT secret
   openssl rand -base64 64
   
   # Update in each Railway service
   railway variables set JWT_SECRET_KEY="<new-secret>" --service auth
   ```

2. **Enable 2FA** on Railway accounts
3. **Review team permissions**
4. **Audit environment variables**

### 1.3 API Security Headers
Update Gateway service to include security headers (see `security-headers.ts`)

## üü† Priority 2: Monitoring & Observability (Week 1)

### 2.1 Uptime Monitoring

- Use sleep mode for dev environments

### 4.2 Vercel Optimization
- Monitor bandwidth usage
- Optimize image delivery
- Enable Edge caching
- Track function invocations

### 4.3 Cost Tracking Dashboard

- Per-service cost allocation
- Optimization recommendations

## üíæ Priority 5: Disaster Recovery (Week 2)

### 5.1 Backup Strategy
- Daily PostgreSQL backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region backup storage
- Automated backup testing

### 5.2 Recovery Procedures
- Service recovery runbook
- Database restoration guide
- Rollback procedures
- Communication plan

### 5.3 Business Continuity
- RTO: 1 hour
- RPO: 15 minutes
- Incident response team
- Regular drills

## üìä Monitoring Setup Commands

### Install Monitoring Script
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/railway-monitoring-setup.sh

# Run setup
./scripts/railway-monitoring-setup.sh
```

### Health Check Dashboard
```bash
# Start real-time monitoring
./scripts/monitor-railway-health.sh
```

### Cost Tracking
```bash
