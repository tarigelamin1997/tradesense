I want you to perform a **complete top-down analysis of my project** and give me a detailed, structured report.

Focus on identifying:

1. ✅ **Any system-level issues**  
   - Especially related to missing dependencies like `libstdc++.so.6`, Python packages not compiling, or broken Nix environment setups.
   - Confirm if `replit.nix` is configured properly and actively being used.

2. ✅ **Python/Streamlit runtime issues**  
   - Errors during app startup, file upload, or module imports.
   - Confirm that the `run` command in `.replit` is correct for launching a Streamlit app.

3. ✅ **File structure problems**  
   - Are important files (like `.replit`, `replit.nix`, `requirements.txt`, `startup.py`, `core/`, `auth/`) where they should be?
   - Are there hidden or broken files (`.venv`, `.pythonlibs`, cache dumps) that should be removed?

4. ✅ **Package issues**  
   - Check if any packages in `requirements.txt` are outdated, missing, or broken.
   - Suggest versions if any upgrades or replacements are needed (e.g., for `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `streamlit-aggrid`).

5. ✅ **Best practice violations**  
   - Security issues (hardcoded secrets, unsafe file uploads)
   - Logging misconfigurations
   - Missing error boundaries in critical scripts (like `startup.py`, `app.py`)

6. ✅ **Replit-specific conflicts**  
   - Any issues caused by Replit’s containerized environment (missing `.so` files, hidden files not being detected, unstable Nix rebuilds, etc.)

7. ✅ **Suggestions to improve**:
   - How to clean up or simplify the `.replit` and `replit.nix` files
   - How to streamline app startup
   - How to better modularize or separate business logic
   - How to prepare the app for stable long-term deployment on Replit or externally

If there are **any shortfalls on my part** (project structure, bad assumptions, config mistakes), highlight them clearly and propose improvements — including file rewrites if needed.

Your output should include:

- A diagnosis summary
- A fix list (with priorities)
- Updated code snippets if required
- Confirmation of what is ready vs. what still needs work

Take a production-minded approach. This app is intended for real users, not just for testing.
