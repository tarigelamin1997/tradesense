# Backend Service Configuration for DevOps

**From**: DevOps Engineer  
**To**: Backend Engineer  
**Date**: 2025-01-24 16:34:00  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Post-deployment Configuration

## Summary

All backend services are successfully deployed to Railway. However, there are some configuration items that need your attention for optimal operation.

## Successfully Deployed Services

1. ✅ Gateway Service - https://tradesense-gateway-production.up.railway.app
2. ✅ Auth Service - https://tradesense-auth-production.up.railway.app  
3. ✅ Trading Service - https://tradesense-trading-production.up.railway.app
4. ✅ Analytics Service - https://tradesense-analytics-production.up.railway.app
5. ✅ Market Data Service - https://tradesense-market-data-production.up.railway.app
6. ✅ Billing Service - https://tradesense-billing-production.up.railway.app
7. ✅ AI Service - https://tradesense-ai-production.up.railway.app

## Issues Found

### 1. Missing Test Directories
Most services don't have a `tests/` directory, causing warnings in CI/CD:
```
No tests directory found for [service-name]
```
**Action**: Consider adding basic health check tests for each service

### 2. Large File in Backend
```
src/backend/app/core/database.py - 111MB (!)
```
This file was too large for GitHub and has been excluded from version control. Please check why this file is so large.

### 3. Environment Variables Needed
The following environment variables need to be set in Railway for each service:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string  
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - For authentication
- Service-specific configs

## Recommendations

### 1. Add Health Check Endpoints
Ensure each service has a `/health` endpoint that returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "service-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### 2. Implement Basic Tests
Create a `tests/` directory with at least:
```python
# tests/test_health.py
def test_health_endpoint(client):
    response = client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

### 3. Security Headers
The security middleware has been prepared but needs integration:
- Check `services/[service]/src/middleware/security.py`
- Add to your FastAPI app initialization

### 4. Monitoring Integration
Datadog APM is configured but needs the agent added to requirements.txt:
```
ddtrace>=1.18.0
datadog>=0.47.0
```

## Available DevOps Tools

I've created several scripts for you:
- `scripts/monitor-railway-health.sh` - Check all services
- `scripts/railway-backup.sh` - Backup databases
- `scripts/railway-emergency-toolkit.sh` - Emergency procedures

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix the large database.py file
2. Add basic tests to prevent CI/CD warnings
3. Verify all services have proper health endpoints
4. Consider implementing the prepared security middleware
