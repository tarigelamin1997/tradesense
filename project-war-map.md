## 🔧 Development Environment Status

- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite (production-ready with migrations)
- **Testing**: Pytest (backend) + Jest (frontend planned)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: Replit (production-ready)

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose SQLite for simplicity and portability
- FastAPI provides excellent API documentation
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

### Known Limitations
- SQLite may need upgrading to PostgreSQL for high concurrency
- No real-time WebSocket implementation yet
- Limited mobile responsiveness in some components

### Performance Optimizations Needed
- Implement database indexing for large datasets
- Add frontend caching strategies
- Optimize SQL queries for analytics endpoints
