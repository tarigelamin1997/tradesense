# Deploy TradeSense Backend as Monolith to Railway

Based on the deployment logs, Railway is deploying the monolithic backend from `/src/backend/`. Let's work with this structure.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Ensure Backend Works Locally First
```bash
cd /home/tarigelamin/Desktop/tradesense/src/backend
python main.py
```

### 2. Create Railway Configuration
Create `railway.toml` in the root directory:

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "cd src/backend && python main.py"
```

### 3. Add Missing Dependencies
The error shows `uvicorn` is trying to import the app but failing. This might be due to missing dependencies or import issues.

### 4. Set Environment Variables in Railway

Go to your Railway project and set these variables:

```bash
# Required
SECRET_KEY=81mLWBLYitjqAy6o7fA8l4HtayOjpS_INXTrpnp1ttA
JWT_SECRET_KEY=rBKId5tLARpQ5n4s_uQq1fuWAx4zbzK60RtYUCQ4OYQ

# CORS
CORS_ORIGINS=https://frontend-7uz3djyzl-tarig-ahmeds-projects.vercel.app,https://tradesense.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001

# Features
ENABLE_SECURITY_HEADERS=true
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true

# Database (Railway provides DATABASE_URL automatically)
# Just make sure you have PostgreSQL service added to your project

# Port (Railway sets this automatically)
# PORT is auto-configured by Railway
```

### 5. Deploy Using Railway CLI
```bash
cd /home/tarigelamin/Desktop/tradesense
railway up
```

## Alternative: Deploy Directly from GitHub

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Railway will auto-deploy on push
3. Set the start command in Railway dashboard:
   ```
   cd src/backend && python main.py
   ```

## Debugging the Current Error

The error `uvicorn.config.py", line 467, in load self.loaded_app = import_from_string(self.app)` suggests uvicorn can't import the app.

This could be due to:
1. Missing Python path configuration
2. Import errors in the code
3. Missing dependencies

### Quick Debug Script
Create `debug_import.py` in root:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src/backend')
try:
    from main import app
    print("✅ Import successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Import failed: {e}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
```

## Simplified Approach

Since the monolithic backend is what's being deployed, ensure:

1. All imports in `src/backend/main.py` are working
2. The PYTHONPATH includes the backend directory
3. All required environment variables are set

## Next Steps

1. Check if PostgreSQL is provisioned in Railway
2. Ensure all environment variables are set
3. Try deploying with the simplified start command
4. Monitor logs for specific import errors
