## 🎯 Risk Assessment

### 🔴 Critical Risks (Immediate Action Required)
1. **No branch protection** - Any developer can push to main
2. **No security scanning in CI** - Vulnerabilities reach production
3. **Single region deployment** - Complete outage risk
4. **No cost controls** - Potential budget explosion

### 🟡 High Risks (Address Within 1 Week)
1. **Limited APM** - Can't troubleshoot performance issues
2. **Manual deployment validation** - Human error risk
3. **Basic alerting only** - Slow incident response
4. **No automated compliance checks** - Audit failures

### 🟢 Medium Risks (Address Within 1 Month)
1. **Resource optimization** - Wasting money on idle resources
2. **Documentation gaps** - Knowledge transfer issues
3. **Limited automation** - Operational overhead

## 📈 Metrics Analysis
