# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Verify schema
psql tradesense_prod -c "\dt"
```

### 2. Backend Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd tradesense

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with production values

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start application
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app
```

### 3. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to hosting service
