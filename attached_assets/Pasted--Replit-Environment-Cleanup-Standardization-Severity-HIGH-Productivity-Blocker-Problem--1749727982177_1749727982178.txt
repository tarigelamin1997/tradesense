üö® Replit Environment Cleanup & Standardization ‚Äì Severity: HIGH (Productivity Blocker) üö®
Problem:
My Replit project has serious environment instability due to a mix of conflicting Python environment tools:

Old virtualenvs, pycache folders, redundant .cache

Multiple package managers (pip, Nix, Replit modules)

Multiple requirements files (requirements.txt, core-requirements.txt)

This is causing slow startups, random rebuilds, broken dependencies, and wasted dev time.

Severity:
7/10 ‚Äì This is a major productivity drain and a future time bomb. If not fixed, future work will get slower and more error-prone.
I need a clean, stable, fast environment for business-critical feature development.

üî® DO THIS EXACTLY (ALL STEPS, IN ORDER):
1. NUCLEAR CLEANUP: Remove all legacy envs, caches, and pyc files

rm -rf venv/ .venv/ .cache/ __pycache__/ .config/
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +



2. MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS: Replace with only the libraries I actually use:
echo "pandas==2.2.2
streamlit==1.31.1
numpy==1.26.4" > core-requirements.txt

(Add any other truly essential packages you use‚ÄîNO excess, keep it lean!)



3. REPLIT CONFIGURATION: Update .replit file to use only built-in modules and minimal requirements

Open .replit and make sure it contains:

[run]
command = "streamlit run app.py --server.port=5000 --server.address=0.0.0.0"

[interpreter]
modules = ["python-3.12"]



4. NIX ENVIRONMENT: Disable custom Nix dependencies

Open (or create) replit.nix and make it EMPTY except for this line:

{ pkgs }: { deps = []; }


5. PIP CACHE CONFIGURATION (Optional but helps):
mkdir -p ~/.cache/pip
export PIP_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/pip"


6. INSTALL FRESH:
pip install --no-cache-dir -r core-requirements.txt


7. VERIFY:

Restart the Replit workspace (Stop & Start)

Check for any errors on startup

Run python -c "import streamlit, pandas, numpy" in the shell ‚Äì there should be NO import errors

8. DELETE ALL UNNECESSARY FILES:

Remove old requirements.txt (if not used)

Remove unused venv/.venv folders

Keep only one requirements file: core-requirements.txt

9. KEEP IT THIS WAY:

NO virtualenv/venv ‚Äì Replit handles the Python environment.

NO conflicting requirements files.

Only use pip or Replit modules for installs‚Äînot both.

Only install what you actually use.

EXPLAIN TO ME CLEARLY:

If you find ANY additional conflicts (Nix, venv, pip), point them out.

If you see any startup warnings or dependency errors, explain them in plain English and how to fix.

üõ°Ô∏è Expected Result:
70% faster startup and reload times

No more random rebuilds or dependency issues

Stable, professional environment to support further business development
DO NOT skip any of the above steps.
DO NOT try to be ‚Äúclever‚Äù by merging solutions.
Just follow this playbook step by step for a guaranteed fix.

If you have questions or see conflicts, STOP and show me the exact issue, don‚Äôt guess.
